							<h4>Referral Links</h4>
                Our Referral Programme pays users 0.5% on the purchase volume purchased by a new user via the user's referral link. The referral programme has an upper limit of 100000 CHF purchase volume per user or the equivalent in any other offered currency. This means that the referral programme is only valid up to a total referral bonus of 500 CHF per user: 100000 CHF * 0.5% = 500 CHF.If the purchase volume of a user exceeds 100000 CHF, which has been transacted via this referral link, no more bonus will be paid.The number of users recruited through referral links, however, is unlimited.Furthermore, the referral programme can be changed or terminated at any time without giving reasons. There is no entitlement to ongoing referral bonus payments in the event of termination of the referral programme.

							<h4>Transaction data</h4>
                In order to be able to offer uncomplicated customer support, volunteer support staff have access to a certain part of the database. This data relates to the user's transactions and includes transaction ID, user ID, IBAN address, amount of the respective transaction and the corresponding transaction information. The first name, last name and other personal data are not part of this data. Furthermore, no conclusions can be drawn from this data to the first and last name and other personal data.

								<h4>Political Risk</h4>
                risksDFX points out that the cryptocurrencies offered are on the DeFiChain blockchain. DeFiChain is a project in the Decentralised Finance (DeFi) business area. Decentralised Finance is a new construct and it is not yet fully clear what the legal and regulatory implications will be for users and companies in this business area. DFX always complies with the current Swiss law and is in constant exchange with the authorities in order to implement this. DFX reserves the right to suspend the trading of individual cryptocurrencies at any time or to include additional cryptocurrencies in trading. Users of the DFX Brokerage Service are not entitled to trade cryptocurrencies if they have previously been suspended from trading, even if these cryptocurrencies have previously been acquired through the DFX Brokerage Service.Furthermore, cryptocurrencies that originate from the Decentralized Finance construct, e.g. through trading on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) or through an exchange through an Atomic Swap, may be declared as higher risk coins and treated differently in the future than coins that have not been in such DeFi protocols. DFX has no influence on how the DeFi market will be regulated in the future and what consequences the use of DeFi protocols may have for users in the future. DFX cannot guarantee that it will continue to operate the Service at all times and DFX cannot guarantee that it will take back any Coins sold if the regulatory environment changes.

You will be required to pay the cost of the enquiries, which will take into account the technical complexity and time involved in the enquiries.Deadline for payment of cryptocurrencyYou must make payment in cryptocurrency within 10 minutes of placing the purchase order.
