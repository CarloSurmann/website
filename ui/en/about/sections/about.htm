					We are helping to achieve maximum freedom by giving anyone responsibility for their own finances, so that no one
					is dependent on third-party providers such as banks, insurance companies or financial service providers, or on
					FIAT-currencies. The right to self-determination over one's own finances is a fundamental part of every individual's
					freedom. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) can guarantee and protect this freedom through decentralized financial
					instruments that are censorship-resistant, expropriation-proof and can be held and traded by anyone individually
					for an unlimited period of time.
					<br />
					<br />
					So far, quite a few steps are required to invest in or trade DeFi assets which prevents many people from using
					this decentralized ecosystem. In particular, the limited user experience and lack of integration of common payment
					systems are barriers that keep potential users away from DeFi.
					<br />
					<br />
					The Decentralized Finance Exchange is stepping up to build the simplest and most intuitive application to allow users
					to invest in any DeFi assets or other cryptocurrencies 24/7 without ever losing control and disposition of those assets.
					To this end, all standard payment systems will be integrated, so that trading DeFi Assets is as natural as any other
					purchase or sale of an asset. The Decentralized Finance Exchange allows people to immediately and easily swap their
					FIAT-currencies into DeFi.
